The `pnpm-lock.yaml` records the JavaScript dependency versions.

ONNX Runtime (desktop CPU and optional web WASM inference): MIT,
https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime
ESPCN model from ONNX Model Zoo: Apache-2.0; included license at
assets/ONNX-ModelZoo-LICENSE.txt. Source model:
https://github.com/onnx/models/tree/main/validated/vision/super_resolution/sub_pixel_cnn_2016
Only obsolete initializer-as-input graph metadata was removed; pretrained
weights were not changed. This small model was selected instead of GAN-based
generation to prioritize source-image reconstruction.
